# Welcome to Catalyst's Storybook

## What is storybook
Storybook is a single source of truth about our design system.

Storybook helps us build UI components in isolation from our app's business logic, data, and context.

## Why do we use storybook
1. It helps EPD understand what already exists in our component library and how to use components consistently.
2. It helps designers document and disseminate design decisions and conventions.
3. It helps engineers understand how to use each component and what the options are.
2. It helps engineers workout on the component library outside of a specific context.
